## **Purpose**  

This guide provides an overview of Jenkins logging. Log files are crucial for tracking Jenkins server activity, job execution, plugin behavior, and system performance. They enable effective diagnostics, monitoring, and security auditing.

## **What Are Jenkins Log Files?**  

Jenkins logs are system-generated records that capture runtime events, configuration changes, and build activity. These files are instrumental in identifying issues and ensuring smooth CI/CD workflows.

## **Why Are Log Files Important?**  

- **Troubleshooting** – Helps pinpoint the root of failures and unexpected behavior.  
- **Monitoring** – Offers visibility into Jenkins system health and build activity.  
- **Auditing** – Tracks configuration and access changes for compliance purposes.  

## **Types of Log Files**  

### **1. Jenkins Master Logs**  
Logs generated by the Jenkins controller:

- `jenkins.log` – Logs startup, shutdown, and internal server errors.  
- `access.log` – Captures HTTP request data for auditing access.  
- `hudson.log` – Provides information on Jenkins’ core operations.  

### **2. Jenkins Agent (Slave) Logs**  
Logs from Jenkins distributed build agents:

- `slave.log` – Tracks job execution and connectivity issues on agent nodes.  
- `agent.log` – Alternative naming convention; logs agent-side activities.  

### **3. Job-Specific Logs**  
Logs associated with individual Jenkins jobs:

- `build.log` – Contains output from build steps, errors, and build status.  
- `consoleText` – UI-accessible plain-text version of the job output.  

### **4. Plugin Logs**  

- `plugin-name.log` – Logs specific plugin-related operations and issues.  

### **5. Audit Logs**  

- `audit.log` – Records user actions, configuration updates, and security-related events.  

## **Log File Locations**  

Jenkins log locations vary by platform and setup:

- **Linux (Default Location):** `/var/log/jenkins/`  
- **Windows:** `C:\Program Files\Jenkins\logs\`  
- **Custom Location:** Configurable in Jenkins settings or during setup.  

## **Priority-Based Log Levels**

Logs in Jenkins are prioritized based on severity:

| **Priority** | **Description** | **Example Logs** |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| **P0 (Critical Issues)** | Severe failures like system crashes or security violations. | `jenkins.log`, `audit.log` |
| **P1 (High Priority Issues)** | Issues such as job crashes, plugin failures. | `build.log`, `plugin-name.log` |
| **P2 (Medium Priority Issues)** | Warnings and minor issues affecting performance. | `hudson.log`, `access.log` |

## **Common Issues and Troubleshooting**

| **Issue**                     | **Problem**                                      | **Solution**                                                     | **Logs to Check**  |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Jenkins Not Starting**       | Jenkins doesn’t boot.                            | Inspect system logs for config problems or port issues.          | - Linux: `/var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log`<br>- Windows: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins\logs\jenkins.log` |
| **Build Failures**             | Builds fail mid-execution.                       | Examine build logs for script problems or environment issues.    | `$JENKINS_HOME/jobs/{job_name}/builds/{build_number}/log` |
| **High CPU or Memory Usage**   | Jenkins slows or hangs.                          | Use logs to identify intensive jobs or misbehaving plugins.       | `/var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log`, `$JENKINS_HOME/logs/` |
| **User Authentication Issues** | Users can’t log in or get access denied errors. | Check access logs and user settings for misconfiguration.         | `/var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log`, `$JENKINS_HOME/logs/` |

## **Log Output**

Below is a typical Jenkins console log from a build job, showcasing step-by-step command execution and any generated messages:

---

## **Best Practices**  

- **Regular Review** – Schedule periodic log reviews to catch problems early.  
- **Log Retention Policies** – Set limits on log history to avoid storage bloat.  
- **Access Control** – Restrict access to sensitive log files to admin users.  

---

## **Conclusion**  

Jenkins logs are fundamental to maintaining a secure, efficient, and resilient CI/CD environment. Familiarity with log types, locations, and analysis practices enables proactive system maintenance and rapid issue resolution.
